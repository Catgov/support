Description:
    A generator to create new request paths quickly. By default it generates a simple form that looks like the general request.

Example:
    rails generate request MyThing

    This will create:
        lib/support/requests/my_thing_request.rb
        test/unit/support/requests/my_thing_request_test.rb
